I am a software developer and leader with fourteen years of professional experience. I studied computer science at Oregon State University and have since developed my skills as a full stack web developer, DevOps engineer and cloud architect. I began my career working at HP where I built my reputation migrating applications to the cloud. I drove the creation of the HP print businesses cloud platform as the lead architect which supports their cloud connected devices, including enterprise and SMB printers. I then moved to Shopify where I worked as a team lead building cutting edge software tooling to accelerate software development. Iâ€™m a futurist and continual learner that loves having an impact while solving challenging problems.
